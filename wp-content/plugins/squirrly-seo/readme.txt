== Description ==
Get Excellent SEO on all your Articles, Pages and WooCommerce products. For both Humans and Search Engines.

All White-hat and up-to-date. Customer Service included on the free plans.

The only WordPress SEO plugin that offers Assisted SEO and all the on-page tools you need to take your site from “Never Found” to Always Found on search engines like Google and Bing.

While Assistant Technology like: Intelligent Parking Assist helps you park your car safely, Squirrly SEO helps you place your pages safely in top positions.

More than that, some of the Assisted SEO features we have on-board actually help you find spots on search engines, where you’ll easily park your pages and nobody will bother you (because the competition will be low, even though these spots could earn you many organic visits).

<a title=“WordPress SEO Plugin” href="https://plugin.squirrly.co/wordpress/seo“>Facts and Testimonials for this Plugin for WordPress SEO can be found here</a>.

Could you ever dream your way to the Top positions on search engines? Let’s see how this WordPress plugin will help:

**Bring a CoPilot Onboard to Accelerate Your SEO Strategy and Keep Ranking**

Everyone who's been in this industry for a hot second knows that competing for the top rankings in Google can feel a lot like racing. Racing in a super fast, insanely crowded, car race where you're competing with bigger, faster, more expensive cars all the time. Everyone's trying to get in front, stand out and smoke the car behind them.

And if Search Engine Optimization is a car race, your website is your race car.

And let’s put it this way: As things stand right now, you could be blindfolded, driving a car not optimized for the race on uncertain track conditions.

But what if you could look to your right and have someone there you can genuinely trust, someone knowledgeable enough to guide and assist you in this race you're competing in every single day as a site owner?

I'm talking about someone whose primary concern is to make your job easier and help you SUCCEED.

That's Squirrly SEO for you.

Squirrly SEO gives you the Knowledge + Tools  + Guidance you need to shift your SEO Results into top Gear:

* The Knowledge to take the blindfold off and maximize your level of SEO awareness. Step-by-step process with learning on the way, which makes it great for those who are not SEO experts. You'll get free coaching sessions to master the basics of SEO and conquer the advanced tactics.

* The Tools you need to successfully implement the best SEO tactics. Top automation features to work smarter and more efficient, from Keyword Research, On-Page Optimization, to a Weekly SEO Audit and everything in between.

* The Guidance to keep you focused and always moving forward through changing SEO scenery, Google updates and more. You'll benefit from constant in-plugin guidance and Assistants, as well as the fact that we're continually adding new features to meet your evolving needs.

It's this combination of tools and guidance that helped our users rank their sites on the 1st Page of Google and grow their organic traffic by at least +285%. (You can get MORE <a href="https://squirrly.co/facts">facts here</a>)

**Squirrly SEO doesn't push you out of the driver's seat.**

Other plugins promise you a way to put your site on AutoPilot. But why risk being on autopilot inside a car that’s on the wrong path? Why give up that level of control when you can choose otherwise?

Squirrly SEO doesn't push you out of the driver's seat. Instead, it fills the role of a savvy SEO ADVISOR to help your rise to the top of SERPs.

And one of the ways it does this is through a set of powerful features. You've guessed it; it's time to see what's under the hood of Squirrly SEO.

**Keyword Research**

Discover long-tail keyword suggestions your site can rank for on the first page of Google directly from your Dashboard. Relevant for the country you want to rank for.

Long-tail keywords have less competition, which means you don't have to go against SEO mammoths, the industry-leading sites which typically populate the 1st page of Google. So you'll have a real chance of making your way to the top of SERPs.

Squirrly's SEO advanced algorithms will reveal top keyword opportunities and feed valuable associated data. This up-to-date information will help you assess keywords' potential; so that you can pick the right ones:

* Discussion. Shows you how popular a topic is on social media.
* Search Volume. Allows you to know what Keywords and Topics your Customers actively search for on Google.
* Competition. Tells you whether you can rank your pages for specific keywords. You'll STOP Wasting your resources creating content blindly and going after keywords your site can't rank for. It will all finally make sense.
* Trend. Shows you the direction in which the interest for a certain topic is heading so that you can be on time with the content you create. Optimizing content for Keywords that have a "steady" or a "going up" trend has the potential to bring you traffic for years to come.

Another cool thing about this feature is that it lets you play with three levels of complexity: Fast, Normal, Complex when conducting a Keyword Research.

**You control your keyword research experience.**

The Fast option will reveal around 10 results while the complex one can deliver around 50 results at once - that's up to 50 new ideas for creating relevant content that has the highest potential for achieving top rankings

What's more, the industry you’re in will be constantly monitored. This allows Squirrly to suggest new topic ideas you can pursue, even if you're not actively doing keyword research.

This way, you can be sure that you're not missing out on any incredible keyword opportunity.

**SEO Live Assistant**

This is your GPS for perfect on-page SEO for every article or page you Publish. Get higher rankings for keywords connected to your brand and outrank your competition.

We built the SEO Live Assistant so that you no longer have to rely on guesswork to make sure you have 100% SEO on your blog posts, your product pages or landing pages.

The Assistant looks at the topic you're writing about and gives you the coordinates for perfect on-page SEO by providing you with as-you-type advice, right inside your WordPress Dashboard.

This saves a lot of time for content creation and it helps with quality assurance as well.
Write with both your audience and search engines in mind.

* Real-time SEO tips
* Makes it clear when you over or under optimize
* Helps you identify and avoid annoying repetitions
* It checks if you have a strong introduction and conclusion for your article, in which you specify the topic you’re writing about.

With the SEO Live Assistant, you can optimize a page or article for multiple keywords. (in order to improve your Rank Brain ratings)

You can also re-optimize existing pages in your site.

But the part you'll love most?

The SEO Live Assistant is fun to use thanks to the gamification elements that make you feel like a champion every time you do something right, and a section in the Assistant turns Green.

When all the boxes check green, your article is fully optimized and ready to be Published.

**Audit Suite**

Just as any race car needs constant maintenance, your site and strategy need to be constantly tracked, tweaked, and improved. From time to time, there will be stuff you need to fix, things you'll add or replace.

If you don’t stick with it, you’re going to fall behind.

Squirrly's Audit Suite monitors all essential aspects of your content marketing strategy and gives you an overall score to note its performance. To do so, it takes six main areas into account:

* Blogging,
* Traffic,
* Social Media,
* SEO,
* Links,
* Authority.

By looking at this data, as a site owner, you'll always know how things stand, whether your efforts are paying off, and which areas need more work. You will no longer have to rely on others' theories and opinions to make decisions.

The way in which the Audit was developed ensures you'll be guided towards the actions you should take to improve your score week after week.

It also makes it easy to share the information with others on your team who have the authority and the knowledge to act on it.

For instance, if you see the blogging frequency decrease in the Audit, you can send that information to your content strategist so that you can get things back on track.

All you have to do is press a button, and the information gets sent via email.

In many ways, the Audit represents the spirit behind Squirrly SEO the best, as it's a clear representation of the vision that has been with us since day one; and that is to guide users towards taking the best actions using the most efficient tools.

**Briefcase, Keyword Strategy Assistant**

How many times has this happened to you? You've started researching ideas for keywords you could use in your posts. After a while, the process became so complex, that you lost count and forgot what was the keyword you began with.

It would be a pity to overlook great keyword opportunities because you don't have an efficient way to stay organized.

The Briefcase feature provides a simple way to keep your best keyword opportunities in a dedicated, single place and build a strategy around your main keywords.

You can Color-Categorize your keywords based on your needs and stay on track with your campaigns.

You choose the label you assign to each keyword in Briefcase.

For instance, you can label them based on the customer journey you want to use them for, such as "awareness stage" or "strong buyer intent."

Everyone on your team will know what they need to work on in order to enhance your Authority on your main keywords. No more losing focus.

**Of Course, Squirrly SEO Helps You with Everything Else as well**

Features that work behind the scenes to help you build a strong Social Media AND SEO Presence

* Twitter Cards
* Facebook Open Graph support for both Images and Videos
* LinkedIN titles, images and description for better sharing
* Rich Pins for Pinterest
* Snippet Preview
* Customize Meta Title and Description
* Patterns
* Sitemap
* Blog feeds
* SEO settings
* Performance Analytics with Google Rank Checker that lets you keep a close eye on your rankings and social media metrics.

* Find and Insert Tweets and Wikis to validate your ideas and create well-researched content that includes trending information and expert input
* Link to other articles in your site connected to that topic
* Cite Sources and prove authority for the blog posts you create. It’s a confirmed ranking factor for Google.

You don't have to be an expert to make the most of all these features. Squirrly SEO has a 'Take you by the hand approach" that works to your benefit even if you are an apprentice when it comes to SEO.

**Satisfies Your Need for Speed**

**If you choose any plugin other than Squirrly, you will soon realize that:**

- you haven’t chosen the proper keywords. That’s why your WordPress SEO Plugin doesn’t catapult you to that first page of Google search, no matter which plugin you choose.

- you can end up being #1 on Google for keywords that nobody ever searches for, which means zero search traffic for your WordPress site or WooCommerce store.

- you don’t know if you manage to rank your pages. The other WordPress SEO plugins won’t show you if they help you reach search engine success.

- you’ve got no proper way of knowing if the work you do with the other plugins actually makes a difference for the overall WordPress SEO of your site.

- you won’t be able to manage your strategy. You’ll keep creating content blindly, while losing focus of your overall strategy. Especially if you have a team of writers, this will go south very fast.

- you'll never know if the work you've done last week brought an improvement in the quality of your site and content.

**There is only one SEO tool (part software in the Cloud, part delivered inside your very own WordPress) to help you with all of this: Squirrly SEO. It's Everything You’ll Ever Need.**
